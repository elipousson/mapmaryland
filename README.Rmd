The goal of mapmaryland is to ease access to spatial data for Maryland at both the local, regional, and statewide level.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mapmaryland like so:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("elipousson/mapmaryland")
```

## Example

Currently, the package has a limited number of data access functions, prepackaged datasets, and reference data with an index of Maryland ArcGIS services.

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(md_arcgis_index)
```
